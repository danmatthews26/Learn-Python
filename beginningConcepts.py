# PRINT FUNCTION
# This is the print function.
# leaving the print function empty will creat a line break
print()

# To put a String into the print function,
# you simply use single or double quote marks, and put the words inside.
# NOTE: If you start with double quotes, you must end with a double quote,
# same rule with single quotes
# print("hey") - valid
# print('hey') - valid
# print("hey') - not valid
# print('hey") - not valid

print('hello with single quotation mark')
print("hello with double quotation marks")
